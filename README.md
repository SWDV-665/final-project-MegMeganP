This project is entirely different than my proposal near the beginning of the course.
I chose to switch projects due to having a better understanding of what Ionic can do.
I changed to Ionic v6 for this project, which has current, working frameworks and components.
I utilized openweathermap.org for my API for the real-time weather data.
My native feature is the ion-refresher-the native pull-down refresher.

If anyone needs the API key to test, you can get one at openweathermap.org, or contact me.
You will need to add latitude and longitude in weather service file.
In the next generation, I would add geolocation so the latitude and longitude would be aoutomatic.
